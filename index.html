                        Ladies and gentlemen of the Frontier Family, did you know that Shayo was officially founded the 31st of March 2017? Meaning that
                        New Dawn is officially more than five year old! <span>However!</span> The term "Frontier Family" would only become adopted later on, and was 
                        in fact suggested by Sora in August 2017!

                    <p>Sadly no backend (Aka login, forums, passwords and etc) can be done until we find a way to upload the website.
                        Otherwise, the website would only be accessible when I locally launch the frontend and backend which is far from ideal.
